# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Overview

The Hubble Network SDK community is composed of developers,
researchers, enthusiasts, and contributors from around the world. We
are all collaborating to build an innovative ecosystem around
space-based connectivity and low-power embedded systems.

We value diversity — in background, perspective, experience, and expertise.

This Code of Conduct exists to ensure that all members of the
community have a safe, respectful, and enriching environment. It
applies to all contributors, maintainers, team members, and users
participating in:

* GitHub repositories (issues, PRs, discussions)
* Forums, mailing lists, meetings, and online/offline events
* Any official space managed by the Hubble Network team

Behavior outside official spaces may also affect participation if it impacts our community.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of:

* Age, body size, visible or invisible disability
* Ethnicity, gender identity and expression
* Level of experience, education, socio-economic background
* Nationality, race, caste, color, religion
* Sexual identity and orientation

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to a welcoming, inclusive, and healthy community.


## Expected Behavior

* ✅ Be friendly and patient
   * Assume good intent. People may be new to the project, to embedded
     development, or to working with satellites.
* ✅ Be welcoming
  * We support people of all backgrounds and identities. We do not tolerate exclusion.
* ✅ Be considerate
  * Your decisions will affect others — maintainers, contributors,
    partners, users, customers.
* ✅ Be respectful
  * We will not agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior.
* ✅ Choose words carefully
  * We are a professional community. Harassment and exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.

Examples of positive behavior:

* Showing empathy and kindness toward others
* Giving and receiving constructive feedback gracefully
* Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
* Focusing on what’s best for the community and project

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or aggressive language
* Personal insults, especially with racist, sexist, or discriminatory terms
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material
* Posting or threatening to post others’ personal information (doxxing)
* Trolling, harassing, derogatory comments, or political attacks
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Repeated unwanted contact — if someone asks you to stop, stop

## When We Disagree

Disagreements — technical or otherwise — are a normal part of collaboration.

* Listen to understand, not to win.
* Remember that different perspectives make the project better.
* Focus on problem-solving rather than assigning blame.

It is human to err; what matters is how we learn and improve.

## Reporting Issues

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

📧 support@hubble.com

Include (if possible):

* Description of what happened
* Link or screenshot of related content
* Names or usernames of people involved
* Whether this is ongoing

Reports sent to this address are accessible only to the Hubble Network
SDK maintainers responsible for community management. Information
shared will not be disclosed publicly.

Hubble Network reserves the right to remove users that violate our
Code of Conduct from Hubble managed spaces.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

Behavior outside official spaces may also affect participation if it
compromises others’ safety or well-being within the community, or if
it directly impacts Hubble Network’s reputation or trust.
