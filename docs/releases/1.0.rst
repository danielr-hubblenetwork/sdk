Release 1.0.0
#############

**Release Date**: January 6, 2026

This is the first stable release of the Hubble Network Device SDK. This release
provides a production-ready SDK for connecting Bluetooth® Low Energy
(BLE) embedded devices to the Hubble **Terrestrial Network**.

.. note::

   The Satellite Network module is not
   included in this release and will be available in a future release.

Overview
********

Release 1.0.0 represents a significant milestone for the Hubble Network Device SDK,
delivering a stable, well-tested foundation for building applications that leverage
Hubble Terrestrial Network (BLE) infrastructure. This release includes
comprehensive platform support, robust security features, and extensive
documentation for BLE network communication.

Key Features
************

Terrestrial Network Support
===========================

The SDK provides full support for the Hubble Terrestrial Network, enabling devices to
participate in secure BLE communication:

- **Secure Communication**: Encryption used for all network communications
- **Advertisement Generation**: API for generating Bluetooth advertisement packets
  compatible with Hubble Network infrastructure
- **Bluetooth Qualification**: The Hubble Network Device SDK has completed
  the Bluetooth Qualification Process (Design Number: Q369913)

Platform Support
================

The SDK supports multiple embedded platforms and RTOS environments:

- **Zephyr**: Full support with reference implementation and best-in-class
  integration
- **FreeRTOS**: Complete support for FreeRTOS-based applications
- **ESP-IDF**: Support for Espressif ESP32 series devices

Modular Architecture
====================

The SDK is built on a modular, extensible architecture:

- **Service Layer**: High-level APIs for BLE (Terrestrial Network) communication
- **Port Layer**: Abstraction layer for easy porting to new RTOS environments
- **Crypto Abstraction**: Support for multiple cryptographic backends (mbedTLS, PSA)

Security Features
*****************

- **256-bit / 128-bit Encryption**: Strong encryption for all BLE network communications
- **Secure Key Management**: APIs for secure key configuration and management
- **Cryptographic Abstraction**: Flexible crypto backend support
- **Security Documentation**: Comprehensive security documentation and
  best practices for vulnerability handling

Documentation
*************

This release includes documentation:

- **API Reference**: Complete API documentation for all SDK functions
- **Quick Start Guides**: Platform-specific getting started guides for Zephyr and
  FreeRTOS
- **Architecture Documentation**: Detailed SDK architecture and design documentation
- **Security Guide**: Security best practices and implementation details
- **Sample Applications**: Working sample applications for BLE beacon functionality

Sample Applications
*******************

The release includes sample applications demonstrating SDK usage:

- **BLE Beacon Sample (Zephyr)**: Complete example for Zephyr platform
- **BLE Beacon Sample (FreeRTOS)**: Example for FreeRTOS/TI CC2340 platform
- **BLE Beacon Sample (ESP-IDF)**: Example for Espressif ESP32 platform
- **BLE Network Sample (Zephyr)**: Network communication example

API Highlights
**************

Core BLE Network APIs:

- ``hubble_init()``: Initialize the SDK with UTC time and encryption key
- ``hubble_utc_set()``: Update UTC time for network synchronization
- ``hubble_key_set()``: Configure encryption key
- ``hubble_ble_advertise_get()``: Generate BLE advertisement packets

Breaking Changes
****************

This is the first stable release. If you are migrating from pre-1.0.0 versions:

- Review API changes in the migration guide below
- Update initialization code to use the new API signatures
- Ensure platform-specific port implementations are updated

Known Limitations
*****************

- **Satellite Network**: The Satellite Network module is not included in this
  release. This release focuses exclusively on Terrestrial Network (BLE)
  functionality.

Migration Guide
***************

For applications upgrading from pre-1.0.0 versions:

1. **Update Initialization**: Ensure ``hubble_init()`` is called with proper UTC
   time and encryption key before using any SDK functions
2. **Review Platform Ports**: Verify that your platform port implementation is
   compatible with version 1.0.0 APIs
3. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all platform dependencies are compatible with
   SDK 1.0.0
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate your application with the new SDK version before
   deploying to production

Compatibility
*************

- **Minimum Requirements**: See platform-specific documentation for hardware and
  software requirements
- **Backward Compatibility**: This release maintains API compatibility within the
  1.x series
- **Future Compatibility**: Future 1.x releases will maintain backward
  compatibility

Testing
*******

This release has been validated through:

- Unit tests for core BLE functionality
- Integration tests for BLE (Terrestrial Network) module
- Platform-specific testing on Zephyr, FreeRTOS, and ESP-IDF
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing where applicable
- Security testing and validation
